# Overview
This web is for me basically. Losing weight is my goal for this month so I created this project which is a shopping list that allows you to add items based on the calory count.

# Web Pages

Overview:
Contains all my products. Each product is generated using an html card component.

Product: 
Displays specific information for the product based on the query that is based on the product id.

How? 
Each element in the overview and product pages are in a json file (api). The id of each element will then define the specifics of each page.
